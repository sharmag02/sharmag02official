        <h2>Blog About Me and Sachin</h2>
        
        <p>Me and Sachin are two good friends. For me he is my well wisher. <br>
            The journey started in Year 2015 when both of us joined BD Public School In class 7th Section H. We joined
            the school on same day,that's why our roll number are 47 and 48. Since we are the new students and remaining
            most of the students are old one so donot talk that much with them at that time. The journeyof friendship
            started there. <br> </p>
